# MyReads: A Book Lending App

This page is the work of Unnar Thor Bachmann.

This is a project in the Udacity's React Nanodegree program.

This project is a React front end project with a Node backend. User can search for books and put them on three different shelves: Currently reading, wanting to read and read. The root url ("/") displays the shelves and the search url ("/search") displays a search page. 

## How this project is implemented.

This projected is implemented in React using JSX, React Router and Webpack. The development environment was NPM and Facebook's Create React App. A [starter](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter) template was provided. The original code was refactored into a proper React project.
